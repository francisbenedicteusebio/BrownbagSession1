Code Refactoring:
A change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior(1) 
Its goals is to improve internal code by making many small changes without altering the code’s external behavior

When to refactor codes:
-If code is difficult to read (ex. spaghetti code, “goto”) it becomes harder to find typos, structural issues, bugs, dependencies, and repetitions. Refactoring to increase readability increases efficiency across all tasks.
-Code bloat and poor performance.
-If the application has lots of bugs. 
-Repetitive Code.

Benefits of refactoring codes:
The effort we put to ensure code quality pays off as the application grows and development continues.
Maintainable.  This is also considered a fundamental quality of software engineering and design. 
Easier to debug, upgrade and understand over the long term.
Easy for other developers to add features.
